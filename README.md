# Time-series-NDVI-prediction-in-GEE

This notebook outlines workflow to calculate time-series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from satellite imageries in Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. In addition two machine learning models were trained to predict NDVI values. State of the art predictive algorithm (FBProphet) improved prediction by 7.85% compared to conventional ARIMA model.
